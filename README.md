# EdgeTX Acro FPV Simulator

This is a simple fpv simulator you can run directly on your EdgeTX radio. Just copy `acro_sim.lua` to SCRIPTS/TOOLS on your sd card (this is what `build.sh` does but it's hardcoded for the mountpoint of my sd card on my laptop.). You can modify the settings by modifying the source code or pressing the telem / page left / page right buttons (this works on my radiomaster pocket, haven't tested on other radios). Pressing telem cycles between which setting you are adjusting, and the page buttons increase or decrease that setting. Press enter (into the dial) to reset.
